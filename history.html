  <h1>üåø A Brief History of Cannabis</h1>
  <p>
    Cannabis has a <span class="highlight">rich history</span> dating back thousands of years. First cultivated in Central Asia,
    it was used for fiber, food, and medicine. Ancient Chinese texts mention cannabis as early as 2700 BCE, where it was
    valued for its healing properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    In ancient India, cannabis was revered as one of the five sacred plants. It appeared in religious rituals and traditional
    Ayurvedic medicine. Meanwhile, the Scythians, an ancient Eurasian nomadic tribe, burned cannabis seeds in ceremonial tents,
    spreading its use across Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the 19th century, Western medicine began using cannabis extracts to treat conditions like pain, insomnia, and nausea.
    However, due to political pressure and racialized propaganda, cannabis was criminalized across much of the world by the
    mid-20th century.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recent decades, public opinion and scientific understanding have shifted dramatically. From <span class="highlight">California‚Äôs medical legalization in 1996</span>
    to full recreational access in over 20 US states, cannabis has made a powerful comeback.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, it fuels a multi-billion-dollar industry, fosters innovation in medicine, and helps reshape laws and culture.
    The story of cannabis is far from over ‚Äî it's a living legacy of healing, resistance, and renewal.
