  <h1>üåø The History of Cannabis</h1>
  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Cannabis has been cultivated for over 10,000 years. The earliest traces come from ancient China and Central Asia, where it was used for fiber, oil, and medicine.</p>
  <p><strong>Spiritual Use:</strong> In India, it became sacred in Hindu rituals as ‚Äúbhang‚Äù. In ancient Scythian and Persian cultures, cannabis smoke was used in spiritual ceremonies to connect with higher realms.</p>
  <p><strong>Medicine:</strong> The ancient Greeks and Egyptians used cannabis for pain relief and inflammation. By the 1800s, it was part of many Western medicine practices.</p>
  <p><strong>Prohibition:</strong> In the 20th century, cannabis was criminalized in many parts of the world, driven by political agendas, racism, and misinformation ‚Äî especially in the U.S. with the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act.</p>
  <p><strong>Modern Revival:</strong> In the 1990s, California legalized medical cannabis. Since then, dozens of countries and U.S. states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use.</p>
  <p><strong>Today:</strong> Cannabis is a multibillion-dollar industry. It fuels innovation in wellness, culture, and even technology. Strains, terpenes, cannabinoids ‚Äî all part of a growing science.</p>
